I am a Ph.D. student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta and a member of the universityâ€™s DB lab. I graduated with B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2017 and 2021, respectively. My research interests focus on data integration, streaming data, and explainability.

Below is a word cloud of my recently published papers:
