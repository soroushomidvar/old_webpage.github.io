I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in computer engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2017 and 2020, respectively, and Currently, I'm a member of the IP-PBX type approval lab at this university.

My research interest focuses on data mining and machine learning, and I am interested in research at the intersection of IoT data and anomaly detection.
