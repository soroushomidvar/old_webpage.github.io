I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Alberta and a member of the DB lab at this university. I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2017 and 2020, respectively.

My research interest focuses on streaming data and machine learning, and I am interested in research at the intersection of IoT data and anomaly detection.
